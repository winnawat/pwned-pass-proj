DATA512 project on exploratory analysis on pwned passwords

# Project proposal
Today, data security is one of the top concerns for both individuals and organizations. We all have sensitive information that we want protected. Unfortunately, nowadays, these information has to be online for them to be useful. Often, the only thing separating bad actors and our important and private data is a password. Still, hacks happen every day and almsot anyone can be a victim of a data breach. [Even Mark Zuckerberg's Twitter was compromised](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/06/mark-zuckerberg-hacked-on-twitter-and-pinterest).  
This project aims to look at what proportions of the passwords that have been dumped on the internet are "easy".  
That is:
- Passwords that are generated from consecutive keys on the keyboard such as "asdfasdf."
- Passwords that are a series of numbers in a date time format. This is uaually the case for passwords derived from birthdays or important dates such as 11072019.
- Passwords that are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
- Any other categories of passwords that may arise as further research into this topic is done.

The intended outcome is to compel individuals to think twice before setting up passwords for anything. Even if that password is not protecting anything important. Passwords that may appear secure may have already been breached for thousands of times by hackers.
